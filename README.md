## 👋 Hi, I’m @pablogore

I’m a backend / platform engineer obsessed with **architecture, governance, and building systems that don’t break at scale**.

I design and build **event-driven, cloud-native platforms** with a strong focus on:

- Identity & policy-driven systems
- Observability and traceability by design
- Clean architecture and DDD
- Reliable workflows with Temporal
- Kubernetes & GitOps
- AI agents + backend integration
- Turning complex systems into something **simpler, safer, and more understandable**

I’m currently building **Syntegrity**, a governance and identity platform for AI agents and distributed systems.

## 👀 I’m interested in ...

- Event-driven architectures
- Platform engineering
- AI + backend systems
- Governance, approvals, evidence, and policy enforcement
- Distributed systems reliability
- Lakehouses, analytics and data platforms
- Developer tooling and automation with AI agents
- Clean, observable, production-ready systems

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

- Advanced AI/LLM system integration into backend platforms
- Lakehouse architectures (Iceberg, Parquet, analytics engines)
- Better ways to automate engineering workflows with AI (Cursor, agents, code generation)
- Improving how governance and identity can be enforced across heterogeneous systems
- New cloud-native patterns for scalable platforms

---

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

- Startups or teams that need **senior backend / platform architecture help**
- Systems that need to scale reliably
- Event-driven or workflow-heavy backends
- Kubernetes / cloud-native modernization
- Observability and production debugging improvements
- AI-driven engineering tooling
- Open source projects related to platform engineering, governance, or distributed systems
